# AirbnbSmartPricingFeature

The following two paragraphs explain how the Airbnb Smart Pricing feature works and what hosts need to do to make it work.

As a host on Airbnb, sometimes you don't know what price to choose for a listing. Some nights can garner higher prices than other nights, due to specific demand factors in your area. For example there may be upcoming events or holidays that will create higher demand for homes such as yours. With the free Airbnb Smart Pricing feature, you don't need to figure out future optimal price for your home.  Airbnb can do the thinking for you. The feature conveniently analyzes supply and demand for any upcoming dates and changes prices dynamically according to projected demand and available supply in your area. This ensures that your listing will be well priced at all times.

Activating the SmartPricing feature for future dates is easy.  Starting from the Airbnb main page, simply click on **Host** and choose **Listing**. Then click on **Pricing**. Click on **Edit** to the right of **Nightly Price**. Then click **On** to the right of **Smart Pricing**. Now you may click on **View Calendar** and view the prices for each date. You can always modify pricing for specific dates by selecting those dates and making changes in the tool box to the right of the calendar. Enjoy hosting on Airbnb!
