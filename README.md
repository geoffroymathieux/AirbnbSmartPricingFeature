# AirbnbSmartPricingFeature
The following explains how the Airbnb SmartPricing feature works and what hosts need to do to make it work.
As a host on Airbnb, you don't need to figure what is the right price to assign to the home that you listed for rent. Sometimes one doesn't know what price to choose for a listing, which is perfectly understandable. Also some nights can garner higher prices than other nights, due to specific demand factors in your area at any particular time. For example there may be an event or a holiday that will create a higher demand for homes in your area. Let Airbnb do the thinking for you!  We analyze supply and demand for upcoming dates and change them according to the market. This ensures that your listing will be competitively priced at all times.
